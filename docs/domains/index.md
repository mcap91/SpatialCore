# Clustering: Niches & Domains

Spatial clustering for tissue architecture analysis.

---

## Overview

SpatialCore provides methods for characterizing tissue microenvironments at two levels:

| Concept | Definition | Key Property |
|---------|------------|--------------|
| **Niche** | Cellular microenvironment archetype defined by cell-type composition | Compositional (location-independent) |
| **Domain** | Spatially contiguous tissue region | Spatial (partitions tissue) |

See [Terminology](../index.md#terminology) for detailed definitions with literature citations.

## Methods

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| [Neighborhood & Niche Analysis](neighborhood_analysis.md) | Clustering neighborhoods by cell-type composition |
| [Domain Detection](domain_detection.md) | Identifying spatially contiguous tissue regions |

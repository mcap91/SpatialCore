# Thresholding

Methods for defining positive cell populations from continuous expression data.

---

## Overview

Spatial transcriptomics data requires robust methods for classifying cells as "positive" or "negative" for markers of interest. SpatialCore provides expression-based classification using metagenes and data-driven thresholds.
